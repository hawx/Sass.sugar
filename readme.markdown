# SASS Sugar

To install: download [Sass.sugar.zip](http://sss.hawx.me/latest/Sass.sugar.zip), unzip by double clicking it, then drag 
into `~/Library/Application Support/Espresso/Sugars` (you may need to use `CMD+SHIFT+G` in the Finder to get to 
`Library`). 

Or to install the sugar using `git` just open the terminal and type:

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Espresso/Sugars
    git clone git://github.com/hawx/Sass.sugar.git
    

## SASS Settings

To use the sass convert features you don't need to do anything different, but I guess most people are like me and have a 
folder for sass files and another for css. To make the sass go into your css folder you will need to change the
preferences.

### For Espresso 1

Open Espresso's preferences and navigate to Advanced. Then in the table called 'Custom shell variables', add an entry 
with name `SASS_DIRECTORY`, and set the value to the name of the folder you usually use for .sass files (eg. I set 
it to `_sass`). Then add another called `CSS_DIRECTORY` and set the value to the folder you usually use for css 
files (eg. `css`).

__NOTE__: You cannot set per-project settings for this.

### For Espresso 2

There are two options for this:

1. Open `Sass.sugar/Support/Scripts/create_css.rb` and change the variables being set on lines 9 and 10 to something like:

        sass = '_sass'
        css = 'css'
        
2. Or set the variables in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` by adding:

        export SASS_DIRECTORY="_sass"
        export CSS_DIRECTORY="css"
